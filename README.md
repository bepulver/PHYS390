# PHYS390
This code takes a json file as a input and parses it to get a list of Monte Carlo generated tracks and their respective errors. It then uses the Dwave Quantum Annealer to cluster each track into clusters. 
The python code labeled (FINAL) is without the json reader. This was a major milestone as it showed we got the QUBO correct and thus got the quantum stuff working.. After that is newer versions to clean and improve the code.

Improvements:

Version 10 has the input set of data with 2 Verticies and 2 Tracks each
Version 11 has the unput set of data with 2 Verticies and 50 teacks each. This is much closer to a real collision in the CMS detector
