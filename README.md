This code takes a json file as a input and parses it to get a list of tracks and their respective errors. It then uses the Dwave Quantum Annealer to cluster each track into clusters.
the python code labeled (FINAL) is without the json reader. This was a major milestone. After that is newer versions to clean and improve the code.
